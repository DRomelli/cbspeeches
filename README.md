# CBSpeeches dataset

This repository contains the dataset of central banker speeches <b collected > collected for Campiglio et al. (2025). To the best of our knowledge, this dataset represents the most comprehensive collection of public speeches by central bankers. It was created by complementing the Central bankers' speeches dataset compiled by the Bank of International Settlement (18,045 speeches) with a systematic scraping of central banks' websites (15,435 new speeches) and archive work (2,007 additional speeches).

The dataset features 35,487 unique speeches from 131 central banks, for the period going from the beginning of January 1986 (date of the first online speech by a central bank) to the end of December 2023. Among those speeches, 5,347 were provided in a non-English language and were translated using Microsoft Translation services.

The dataset is available free of charge for academic research and personal non-commercial use. It can be downloaded in various formats below, or explored using an interactive app with the link at the top of this page.
