# CBSpeeches dataset

This repository contains the dataset of central banker speeches (**CBS dataset**) collected for Campiglio, Deyris, Romelli and Scalisi (2025). This dataset has been created by complementing the Central bankers' speeches dataset compiled by the [Bank of International Settlement](https://www.bis.org/cbspeeches/index.htm) (18,045 speeches) with a systematic scraping of central banks' websites (15,435 new speeches) and archive work (2,007 additional speeches).

The dataset features **35,487 unique speeches from 131 central banks**, for the period going from the **beginning of January 1986** (date of the first online speech by a central bank) **to the end of December 2023**. Among those speeches, 5,347 were provided in a non-English language and were translated using Microsoft Translation services.

The dataset is freely available for academic research and personal non-commercial use on the [www.cbspeeches.com](https://www.cbspeeches.com) website.
